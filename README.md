## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains anonymized medical diagnostic measurements of women, including:

Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration

BMI: Body Mass Index

Age: Age in years

Insulin: 2-hour serum insulin levels

Outcome: Diabetes diagnosis (1 = diabetic, 0 = non-diabetic)

## Summary and Findings

Several key patterns emerged from the exploratory data analysis of the health-related variables in the dataset. Some variables exhibited skewed or non-normal distributions, indicating the potential need for transformation or the use of non-parametric methods. Others followed approximately normal distributions, making them suitable for traditional parametric analyses. Certain variables also showed signs of data quality issues, such as implausible zero values, which may need to be treated as missing data. Additionally, the target variable, diabetes diagnosis, is binary and fits a binomial distribution, confirming the appropriateness of classification models such as logistic regression. Overall, these findings inform data preparation decisions and guide the selection of appropriate statistical techniques for modeling and inference in the subsequent phases of the study.
